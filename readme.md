Postman makes it easy to send POST/GET/etc requests to endpoints, perfect for HTTP triggered functions! Download it here: [Postman download page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Testing a Local Function
- In Postman, click `Import` and find the collection in the repo named `AzureSamples.postman_collection.json` [found here](AzureSamples.postman_collection.json)
